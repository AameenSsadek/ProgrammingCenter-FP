# ProgrammingCenter-FP
My first project - for user &amp; admin usage.

## Info
This project is a programming center.
Contains two sections:
The first section is for student or learner use. He can register for any course he needs from any department if available.
The second section is for the person responsible for the center. He can do all the things that the learner does by registration, 
modifying and deleting the registeration. He also monitors the gains and number of students and add other admin and do many things.
## Notes
1. The Project doesn't complete.
2. The student can only register in a course from the department after it had been added by the admin. So, first add a department and courses.
3. It should be noted that the sections and materials must be written in their proper names so that the student can register without problems.
dep : Front End or Back End or Full Stack
course : as it written in user dashboard.

4. You can register as admin by:
user : amin
pass : amin12345
5. Another note is that the necessary section in the frontend user page only works properly and the rest does not work, 
so you can try in this section only( first 5 courses in frontend dep).
